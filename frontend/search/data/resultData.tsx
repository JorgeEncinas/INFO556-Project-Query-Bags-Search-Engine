 ( \/ \u00e6 n \u02c8 d r \u0252 m \u0268 d \u0259 \/) is a spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (2.4 \u00d7 10 19 km) from Earth in the Andromeda constellation.\nAlso known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, it is often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest spiral galaxy to our Milky Way galaxy, but not the closest galaxy overall.\nIt gets its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is the largest galaxy of the Local Group, which also contains the Milky Way, the Triangulum Galaxy, and about 30 other smaller galaxies.\nAlthough the largest, the Andromeda Galaxy may not be the most massive, as recent findings suggest that the Milky Way contains more dark matter and could be the most massive in the grouping.\nThe 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that M31 contains one trillion (10 12) stars: at least twice the number of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, which is estimated to be 200\u2013400 billion.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be 7.1 \u00d7 10 11 solar masses.\nIn comparison a 2009 study estimated that the Milky Way and M31 are about equal in mass, while a 2006 study put the mass of the Milky Way at ~80% of the mass of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe two galaxies are expected to collide in 3.75 billion years, eventually merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy.\nAt an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is notable for being one of the brightest Messier objects, making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.\nAlthough it appears more than six times as wide as the full Moon when photographed through a larger telescope, only the brighter central region is visible to the naked eye or when viewed using binoculars or a small telescope.\nObservation history\nGreat Andromeda Nebula by Isaac Roberts\nThe Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi wrote a tantalizing line about the chained constellation in his Book of Fixed Stars around 964, describing it as a \"small cloud\".\nStar charts of that period have it labeled as the Little Cloud.\nThe first description of the object based on telescopic observation was given by German astronomer Simon Marius on December 15, 1612.\nCharles Messier catalogued it as object M31 in 1764 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer, unaware of Al Sufi's earlier work.\nIn 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of the M31.\nHe believed it to be the nearest of all the \"great nebulae\" and based on the colour and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius.\nWilliam Huggins in 1864 observed the spectrum of M31 and noted that it differed from a gaseous nebula.\nThe spectra of M31 displayed a continuum of frequencies, superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the chemical composition of an object.\nThe Andromeda nebula was very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this it was deduced that M31 had a stellar nature.\nIn 1885, a supernova  (known as S Andromedae) was seen in M31, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy.\nAt the time M31 was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a nova, and was named accordingly \"Nova 1885\".\nThe first photographs of M31 were taken in 1887 by Isaac Roberts from his private observatory in Sussex, England.\nThe long-duration exposure allowed the spiral structure of the galaxy to be seen for the first time.\nHowever, at the time this object was still commonly believed to be a nebula within our galaxy, and Roberts mistakenly believed that M31 and similar spiral nebulae were actually solar systems being formed, with the satellites nascent planets.\nThe radial velocity of this object with respect to our solar system was measured in 1912 by Vesto Slipher at the Lowell Observatory, using spectroscopy.\nThe result was the largest velocity recorded at that time, at 300 kilometres per second (190 mi\/s), moving in the direction of the Sun.\nIsland universe\nLocation of M31 in the Andromeda constellation\nIn 1917, American astronomer Heber Curtis observed a nova within M31.\nSearching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered.\nCurtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky.\nAs a result he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 500,000 light-years (3.2 \u00d7 10 10 AU).\nHe became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.\nIn 1920, the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Curtis took place, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the universe.\nTo support his claim that the Great Andromeda Nebula (M31) was an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes resembling the dust clouds in our own Galaxy, as well as the significant Doppler shift.\nIn 1922 Ernst \u00d6pik presented a very elegant and simple astrophysical method to estimate the distance of M31.\nHis result put the Andromeda Nebula far outside our Galaxy at a distance of about 450,000 parsec, which is about 1,500,000 ly.\nEdwin Hubble settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic Cepheid variable stars for the first time on astronomical photos of M31.\nThese were made using the 2.5-metre (100-in) Hooker telescope, and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined.\nHis measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature was not a cluster of stars and gas within our Galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from our own.\nStars in the Andromeda Galaxy's disc\nM31 plays an important role in galactic studies, since it is the nearest spiral galaxy (although not the nearest galaxy).\nIn 1943 Walter Baade was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nBased on his observations of this galaxy, he was able to discern two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II.\nThis nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere.\n(The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort.)\nDr. Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to M31, as well as the remainder of the Universe.\nRadio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was first detected by Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory using the 218-ft Transit Telescope, and was announced in 1950 (Earlier observations were made by radio astronomy pioneer Grote Reber in 1940, but were inconclusive, and were later shown to be an order of magnitude too high).\nThe first radio maps of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group.\nThe core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalogue.\nIn 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThis candidate was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.\nGeneral\nThe Andromeda Galaxy as seen by NASA 's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer\nThe measured distance to the Andromeda Galaxy was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another, dimmer type of Cepheid.\nIn the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.\nFormation and History\nAccording to a team of astronomers reporting in 2010, M31 was formed out of the collision of two smaller galaxies between 5 and 9 billion years ago.\nA paper published in 2012 has outlined M31's basic history since its birth.\nAccording to it, Andromeda was born roughly 10 billion years ago from the merger of many smaller protogalaxies, leading to a galaxy smaller than the one we see today.\nThe most important event in M31's past history was the merger mentioned above that took place 8 billion years ago.\nThis violent collision formed most of its (metal-rich) galactic halo and extended disk and during that epoch Andromeda's star formation would be very high, to the point of becoming a Luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 millon years.2\u20134 billion years ago, M31 and the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) had a very close passage.\nThis event produced high levels of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk - even some globular clusters - and disturbed M33's outer disk.\nWhile there has been activity during the last 2 billion years, this has been much lower than during the past.\nThere have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already disappeared absorbed by M31 that have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream and a merger roughly 100 million years ago that is behind a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the centre of M31 as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years) stellar population.\nDuring this epoch, star formation through M31's disk decreased to the point of nearly shutting down to increasing again relatively recently.\nRecent distance estimate\nAt least four distinct techniques have been used to measure distances to the Andromeda Galaxy.\nIn 2003, using the infrared surface brightness fluctuations (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value of Freedman et al.\n2001 and using a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex \u22121 in (O\/H), an estimate of 2.57 \u00b1 0.06 megalight-years (790 \u00b1 18 kpc) was derived.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy pictured in ultraviolet light by GALEXUsing the Cepheid variable method, an estimate of 2.51 \u00b1 0.13 Mly (770 \u00b1 40 kpc) was reported in 2004.\nIn 2005 Ignasi Ribas ( CSIC, Institute for Space Studies of Catalonia (IEEC)) and colleagues announced the discovery of an eclipsing binary star in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe binary star, designated M31VJ00443799+4129236, has two luminous and hot blue stars of types O and B.\nBy studying the eclipses of the stars, which occur every 3.54969 days, the astronomers were able to measure their sizes.\nKnowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure the absolute magnitude of the stars.\nWhen the visual and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be measured.\nThe stars lie at a distance of 2.52 \u00b1 0.14 Mly (770 \u00b1 43 kpc) and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about 2.5 Mly (770 kpc).\nThis new value is in excellent agreement with the previous, independent Cepheid-based distance value.\nM31 is close enough that the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method may also be used to estimate its distance.\nThe estimated distance to M31 using this technique in 2005 yielded 2.56 \u00b1 0.08 Mly (780 \u00b1 25 kpc).\nAveraged together, all these distance measurements give a combined distance estimate of 2.54 \u00b1 0.11 Mly (780 \u00b1 34 kpc).\nBased upon the above distance, the diameter of M31 at the widest point is estimated to be 141 \u00b1 3 kly (43,000 \u00b1 920 pc).\nApplying trigonometry  ( arctangent), that figures to extending at an apparent 3.18 \u00b0 angle in the sky.\nMass and luminosity estimates\nMass estimates for the Andromeda Galaxy's halo (including dark matter) give a value of approximately 1.23 \u00d7 10 12M \u2609  (or 1.2 trillion solar masses) compared to 1.9 \u00d7 10 12 M \u2609 for the Milky Way.\nThus M31 may be less massive than our own galaxy, although the error range is still too large to say for certain.\nEven so, the masses of the Milky Way and M31 are comparable, and M31's spheroid actually has a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way.\nIn particular, M31 appears to have significantly more common stars than the Milky Way, and the estimated luminosity of M31, ~2.6 \u00d7 10 10 L \u2609, is about 25% higher than that of our own galaxy.\nHowever the rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher, with M31 producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3\u20135 solar masses for the Milky Way.\nThe rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of M31.\nThis suggests that M31 once experienced a great star formation phase, but is now in a relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation.\nShould this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of M31.\nLocal group (clickable map)Structure\nThe Andromeda Galaxy seen in infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope, one of NASA 's four Great Space Observatories\nImage of the Andromeda Galaxy taken by Spitzer in infrared, 24 micrometres (Credit: NASA \/ JPL\u2013 Caltech\/K.\nGordon, University of Arizona)A Swift Tour of Andromeda Galaxy\nA Galaxy Evolution Explorer image of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe bands of blue-white making up the galaxy's striking rings are neighborhoods that harbour hot, young, massive stars.\nDark blue-grey lanes of cooler dust show up starkly against these bright rings, tracing the regions where star formation is currently taking place in dense cloudy cocoons.\nWhen observed in visible light, Andromeda\u2019s rings look more like spiral arms.\nThe ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA\u2019s Spitzer Space Telescope.\nAstronomers using Spitzer interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbour, M32, more than 200 million years ago.\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA (s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies.\nHowever, data from the 2MASS survey showed that the bulge of M31 has a box-like appearance, which implies that the galaxy is actually a barred spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, with the Andromeda Galaxy's bar viewed almost directly along its long axis.\nIn 2005, astronomers used the Keck telescopes to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.\nThis means that the spiral disk of stars in M31 is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated.\nThis constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than 220,000 light-years (67,000 pc) in diameter.\nPreviously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from 70,000 to 120,000 light-years (21,000 to 37,000 pc) across.\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to the Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side).\nAnalysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.\nA possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near M31.\nThe galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in M31's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the rotational velocity of M31 at various radii from the core.\nIn the vicinity of the core, the rotational velocity climbs to a peak of 225 kilometres per second (140 mi\/s) at a radius of 1,300 light-years (82,000,000 AU), then descends to a minimum at 7,000 light-years (440,000,000 AU) where the rotation velocity may be as low as 50 kilometres per second (31 mi\/s).\nThereafter the velocity steadily climbs again out to a radius of 33,000 light-years (2.1 \u00d7 10 9 AU), where it reaches a peak of 250 kilometres per second (160 mi\/s).\nThe velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around 200 kilometres per second (120 mi\/s) at 80,000 light-years (5.1 \u00d7 10 9 AU).\nThese velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about 6 \u00d7 10 9 M \u2609 in the nucleus.\nThe total mass of the galaxy increases linearly out to 45,000 light-years (2.8 \u00d7 10 9 AU), then more slowly beyond that radius.\nThe spiral arms of M31 are outlined by a series of H II regions that Baade described as resembling \"beads on a string\".\nThey appear to be tightly wound, although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy.\nRectified images of the galaxy show a fairly normal spiral galaxy with the arms wound up in a clockwise direction.\nThere are two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about 13,000 light-years (820,000,000 AU).\nThese can be followed outward from a distance of roughly 1,600 light-years (100,000,000 AU) from the core.\nThe most likely cause of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with galaxy M32.\nThis can be seen by the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars.\nIn 1998, images from the European Space Agency 's Infrared Space Observatory demonstrated that the overall form of the Andromeda Galaxy may be transitioning into a ring galaxy.\nThe gas and dust within M31 is generally formed into several overlapping rings, with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of 32,000 light-years (2.0 \u00d7 10 9 AU) from the core.\nThis ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust.\nClose examination of the inner region of M31 showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago.\nSimulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the galaxy in Andromeda along the latter's polar axis.\nThis collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in M31.\nStudies of the extended halo of M31 show that it is roughly comparable to that of the Milky Way, with stars in the halo being generally \" metal-poor\", and increasingly so with greater distance.\nThis evidence indicates that the two galaxies have followed similar evolutionary paths.\nThey are likely to have accreted and assimilated about 1\u2013200 low-mass galaxies during the past 12 billion years.\nThe stars in the extended halos of M31 and the Milky Way may extend nearly one-third the distance separating the two galaxies.\nNucleus\nHST image of the Andromeda Galaxy core showing possible double structure.\nNASA \/ ESA photo\nM31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very centre.\nIn a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge.\nThe luminosity of the nucleus is in excess of the most luminous globular clusters.\nChandra X-ray telescope image of the center of M31.\nA number of X-ray sources, likely X-ray binary stars, within Andromeda's central region appear as yellowish dots.\nThe blue source at the centre is at the position of the supermassive black hole.\nIn 1991 Tod R. Lauer used WFPC, then on board the Hubble Space Telescope, to image M31's inner nucleus.\nThe nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by 1.5 parsecs (4.9 ly).\nThe brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy.\nThe dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true centre of the galaxy and contains a black hole measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10 7 M \u2609 in 1993, and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10 8 M \u2609 in 2005.\nThe velocity dispersion of material around it is measured to be \u2248 160 km\/s.\nScott Tremaine has proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole.\nThe eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars.\nP2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars.\nThe A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.\nWhile at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus was the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by M31, this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to tidal disruption by the central black hole.\nWhile this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its centre.\nSatellites\nLike the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has satellite galaxies, consisting of 14 known dwarf galaxies.\nThe best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110.\nBased on current evidence, it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with M31 (Andromeda) in the past.\nM32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.\nM110 also appears to be interacting with M31, and astronomers have found in the halo of M31 a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies.\nM110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.\nIn 2006 it was discovered that nine of these galaxies lie along a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy, rather than being randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions.\nThis may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites.\nFuture collision with the Milky Way\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 100 to 140 kilometres per second (62 to 87 mi\/s) which is about 1.96 billion to 2.74 billion miles per year, making it one of the few blueshifted galaxies.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are thus expected to collide in about 4.5 billion years, although the details are uncertain since Andromeda's tangential velocity with respect to the Milky Way is known to only within about a factor of two.\nA likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy.\nSuch events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups.\nThe fate of the Earth and the Solar System in the event of a collision is currently unknown.\nIf the galaxies do not merge, there is a small chance that the Solar System could be ejected from the Milky Way or join M31.\nSubjects\nArt\nBusiness Studies\nCitizenship\nCountries\nDesign and Technology\nEveryday life\nGeography\nHistory\nInformation Technology\nLanguage and literature\nMathematics\nMusic\nPeople\nPortals\nReligion\nScience\nTitle Word Index\nWikipedia for Schools is a selection taken from the original English-language Wikipedia by the child sponsorship charity SOS Children.\nIt was created as a checked and child-friendly teaching resource for use in schools in the developing world and beyond.\nSources and authors can be found at www.wikipedia.org.\nSee also our Disclaimer.\nThese articles are available under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike Version 3.0 Unported Licence.\nThis article was sourced from http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/?oldid=543692330 .\n\n",

Aguilar (Cf\nA)Andromeda and the Milky Way are heading on a collision course that will alter the structure of the two galaxies forever.\nThe galaxies are rushing closer to one another at about 70 miles per second (112 kilometers per second).\nAstronomers estimate that Andromeda will collide with the Milky Way in 4 billion years, with the merger concluding 6 billion years from now.\nBy that time, the sun will have swollen into a red giant and swallowed up the terrestrial planets, so Earth will have other things to worry about.\n[ Milky Way Galaxy's Head-On Crash with Andromeda in Pictures (Gallery)]Still, the fresh influx of dust should boost star formation in the new \"Milkomeda\" galaxy, and the Earthless sun may well leave the Milky Way for good.\nAfter a messy phase, where arms project crazily from the combined pair, the two should settle into a smooth elliptical galaxy.\nGalaxy collisions are a normal part of the universe's evolution.\nIn fact, both Andromeda and the Milky Way bear signs of having already crashed into other galaxies.\nAndromeda boasts a large ring of dust in its center, giving it an interesting shape.\nAstronomers believe this dust may have formed when it swallowed an existing galaxy.\nEarly observational history\nIn 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi described the galaxy as a \"small cloud\" in his \"Book of Fixed Stars,\" the first known report of our nearest neighbor.\nWhen Charles Messier labeled it M31 in 1764, he incorrectly credited the discovery of what was then called a nebula to the German astronomer, Simon Marius, who provided the first telescopic observation of the object.\nThe first photographs of Andromeda were taken in 1887, by Isaac Roberts.\nThis image of the Andromeda Galaxy is a composite of an infrared photo from ESA's Herschel space telescope and the XMM-Newton\u2019s X-ray telescope.\nThe infrared frame shows rings of dust that trace gaseous reservoirs where new stars are forming and the X-ray image shows stars approaching the ends of their lives.\nCredit: ESA\/Herschel\/PACS\/SPIRE\/J.\nFritz, U.\nGent\/XMM-Newton\/EPIC\/W.\nPietsch, MPEIn the 1920s, the distant galaxy became part of the Great Debate between American astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis.\nAt the time, astronomers thought the Milky Way composed the whole universe, and the strange patches known as nebulae lay inside of them.\nCurtis had spotted various novae in Andromeda, and argued instead that it was a separate galaxy.\nThe discussion wasn't concluded until 1925, when Edwin Hubble identified a special kind of star known as a Cepheid variable \u2014 a star whose characteristics allow for precise measurements of distance \u2014 within Andromeda.\nBecause Shapley had previously determined that the Milky Way was only 100,000 light-years across, Hubble's calculations revealed that the fuzzy patch was too far away to lie within the Milky Way.\nHubble went on to use his measurements of the Doppler shifts of the galaxies to determine that the universe was expanding.\nThe calculated distance to Andromeda doubled in the 1940s when Walter Baade was the first to observe individual stars in the central region of the galaxy, and found two different types of Cepheid variables.\nRadio maps of Andromeda followed in the 1950s, after radio emissions were detected by Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory.\nBy measuring the motion of M31 (Andromeda Galaxy), data from the Hubble Space Telescope has confirmed that our galaxy is on a head-on crash course with it.\nIt is estimated to occur in 4 billion years.\nRecent Andromeda discoveries\nOur understanding of the size of the Andromeda galaxy has grown bigger in recent years.\nIn 2015, observations from the Hubble Space Telescope found that a halo of material surrounding Andromeda is six times larger and 1,000 times more massive than what was previously measured.\n(At the time, astronomers said the Milky Way may have a halo as well \u2014 and perhaps the two galaxies' halos are already starting to merge.)\nThis follows on from revised size estimates in 2005 and 2007, based on observing stars and star motions.\nIn 2015, scientists released the most detailed photo of Andromeda ever using a mosaic of images from the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe image included 7,398 exposures taken over 411 pointings of the telescope.\nThe image revealed more than 100 million stars within the galaxy, as well as dust structures and other features.\nAt the time, scientists said the images would help with extrapolating the structure of spiral galaxies that are even farther from Earth, making them more difficult to view in such detail.\nBlack hole activities within Andromeda also came under scrutiny.\nIn late 2017, scientists unexpectedly found two supermassive black holes closely orbiting each other.\nAt the time, the research team said these black holes were likely the \"most tightly coupled\" of any supermassive ones known.\nA search using NASA's Chandra X-Ray Telescope yielded 26 black hole candidates in Andromeda in 2013, making this the biggest catch of such candidates ever found in another galaxy besides our own Milky Way.\nAnother 40 black holes were tracked down in 2016 using NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (Nu\nSTAR), which specializes in X-ray observations.\nScientists tracked down a probable pulsar \u2014 a dead star that spins rapidly \u2014 in Andromeda in 2017.\nThe X-ray source was first cataloged by NASA's Swift satellite as object Swift J0042.6+4112, and then characterized by Nu\nSTAR.\nThe newer observations found that this object's spectrum of light appears similar to pulsars in the Milky Way.\nOther miscellaneous discoveries in Andromeda include tracking star birth and death in infrared wavelengths in 2011; discovering gamma-ray radiation in 2017 that could be an indication of dark matter, a substance that is only known through its effects on \"ordinary\" matter such as galaxies; and spotting a ring of dwarf galaxies around Andromeda in 2013 \u2014 something that could also be present around the Milky Way.\nAdditional reporting by Elizabeth Howell, Space.com contributor\nYou'd Also Like\nGalaxies: Collisions, Types & Other Facts\nSpace\nAndromeda Galaxy's Exotic X-Ray Signal Actually a Bright Black

Messier has investigated it with different instruments and he didn't recognise a star; it resembles two cones or pyramids of light, opposed at their bases, the axes of which are in direction NW-SE; the two points of light or the apices are about 40 arc minutes apart; the common base of the pyramids is about 15'.\nThis nebula was discovered by Simon Marius, and consequently observed by different astronomers.\nM. Le Gentil has given a drawing in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1759, page 453.\nIt is reported on the English Atlas\" (diam.\n40').\nMessier sketched M 31, M 32 and M 110.\nThe sketch (see image below) was originally published in 1807 in the Connaissance des Temps.\n(See also the SEDS Messier Catalogue)M 31, M 32 and M 110 by Charles Messier\nMessier saw (like all other observers before him) M 31 as a nebula, not as a galaxy.\nHerschel, Bode and Smyth also saw M 31 as \"a nebula in Andromeda\".\nIt was Edwin Hubble who established the intergalactic distance and the true nature of M 31 as a galaxy.\nThis was in 1923, when he found the first Cepheid variable in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nHubble published his study of the Andromeda \"nebula\" as an extragalactic system (galaxy) in 1929.\nSince then M 31, the great nebula in Andromeda is known as the Andromeda Galaxy.\nWhere to find M 31To locate M 31 and its two companions M 32 and M 110, we have to start at Beta Andromedae.\nFrom Beta Andromedae go 4\u00b0 north to Mu Andromedae, a star of magnitude 3.8.\nThen go further north about 3\u00b0 to Nu Andromedae, a 4.5 magnitude star.\nJust 1\u00b0 northwest of Nu Andromeda you will find M 31, the Andromeda Galaxy.\nAs I mentioned earlier, even under suburban skies you should be able to spot M 31 with your naked eyes as a fuzzy patch of light (use averted vision if necessary).\nIf you live in an area which is heavily light polluted, use binoculars or a finder-scope.\nCredit and \u00a9 Software Bisque, \u201cThe\nSky for Macintosh\u201dMy observing log entries of M 31If you want to observe galaxies, you should do this from a dark sky site, free of light pollution.\nWith M 31 however, it is a bit different.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy can be observed from suburban areas very well.\nOver the years I have been observing M 31 with different instruments from three different locations.\nFrom my own backyard I've used 7x50 and 15x80 binoculars.\nFrom two superb dark-sky sites I used the 15x80 binoculars and a high quality 12.5-inch Dobson.\nI did all binocular observing using the Sky Window mirror mount.\n1.\nWith Bresser 7x50 binoculars from my own backyard (450 feet altitude) From my own backyard I regularly observed M 31 with 7x50 Bresser binoculars (field of view 6.1 degrees).\nAt first sight the bright central part of the Andromeda Galaxy appeared as a football-shaped greyish-white smudge of light, about one degree wide.\nAfter 10 minutes of concentrated observing, using averted vision, I could see the Andromeda Galaxy as 2-degree wide elongated object with a bright core.\nThe surface brightness of M 31 was gradually decreasing towards the edge of the 2-degree wide oval.\nMoving the mirror of the Sky Window up and down very slowly didn't make any difference.\nI got the same results with direct vision.\nI did not see any dark lanes or any other details in M 31.\nI did not detect M 32 or M 110.\n2.\nWith a 12.5-inch ICS Dobson from a rural site (5,400 feet altitude) In September 2003 I visited a star party in Austria, and had the opportunity to observe M 31 through a high-quality 12.5-inch Dobson from ICS (Intercon Spacetec).\nThe altitude was 5.400 feet and the seeing was moderate; the limiting magnitude was about 6.5 to 7 in the zenith.\nWith a 27mm Panoptic (55x) installed I observed the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy, about 1.5 degrees wide.\nIt was an amazing sight.\nThe central region of the galaxy was very bright with a star-like core, and filled almost the whole field of view from left to right.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy was \"cut off\" at the edges of the field of view.\nThere was a dark lane visible to the north-northwest of the centre of M 31.\nI could see this dark lane with direct vision.\nWhen I looked through the eyepiece, from the first moment on, the dark lane was just there.\n3.\nWith Vixen 15x80 binoculars from my own backyard (450 feet altitude) In December 2003 I observed M 31 with the 15x80 binoculars for the first time.\nI observed from my own backyard, and the limiting magnitude was about 4.7 in the zenith.\nThe 15x80 has a field of view of 3.5 degrees.\nThe results I got that night where by far superior to what I head seen through my 7x50.\nThe galaxy was at least 2.5 degrees wide with a very bright nucleus.\nAfter a few minutes of observing I could see the two companions of M 31.\nFirst I spotted the bright, stellar-like M 32.\nIt looked like a \"fuzzy\" star.\nThen, after another few minutes of observing, I saw M 110 as well.\nIt looked like a small, elongated oval patch of greyish light.\nI did not detect any dark lanes or other details in M 31, but during the observing session, the image got better and better.\nI used an old T-shirt, draped over my head (and binoculars), as a kind of cloak against stray light, and I noticed that with a lot of patience you can see more than you first expect.\nYou have to be patient with the Andromeda Galaxy, but you will rewarded for your patience.\n4.\nWith Vixen 15x80 binoculars from a semi-rural site (2,400 feet altitude) In September 2004 I observed M 31 from a dark-sky site in Bavaria in Germany (altitude 2400 feet) again with the 15x80 binoculars.\nIt was a very clear, transparent night and the limiting magnitude was about 6.5 in the zenith.\nThe views I got that night from the Andromeda Galaxy where simply stunning.\nI aimed the binoculars at M 31 and when I looked through it, wham!\nThere was M 31, about 3 degrees wide, together with M 32 and M 110.\nI couldn't believe my eyes.\nNo averted vision.\nNo concentrated observing for half an hour.\nThe three galaxies where visible at first sight!\nAfter a while I slowly moved the mirror of the Sky Window up and down.\nM 31 seemed to be even wider than 3 degrees.\nIt was as if it \"touched\" the edges of my 3.5-degree field of view.\nI observed for 35 minutes, but I could not see the dark lanes.\nIt probably takes a real big binocular or telescope with a larger aperture to detect them.\nWhat to expect when observing M31?\nM 31 is a perfect object for binoculars and rich-field telescopes.\nIt is very rewarding, even when observed from a suburban site with a moderate instrument.\nFrom a dark-sky site the views you get are very hard to describe in words.\nThe sketch below should give you an idea of what to expect.\nSue French made it on the night of November 4 1999, at 8 PM EST.\nShe was observing M 31 from her own backyard, a semi-rural site about 7 miles away from a city with a population of 61.000.\nShe used a 4.1-inch f\/5.8 apochromat (AP Traveler) in combination with a 35mm Panoptic.\nThe true field of view is about 4 degrees.\nSue rated the seeing as fair and the transparency was good.\nI adjusted the orientation of the sketch to the naked-eye view.\nNorth is up and East is to the left.\nImage credit: Sue French\nWith larger telescopes, it is possible to see a lot of globular clusters and HII regions in M 31.\nIn the southwestern part of M 31 lies NGC 206, a stellar association that is visible in medium to large telescopes.\nIf you are interested in observing M 31 in detail, you can use one of the two online atlases of the M 31.\nOne is The M 31 Atlas by John Blackwell and the other is the Atlas of the Andromeda Galaxy by Paul W.

see below for original picture credits.\nAnd I have to say, that looks about right to me!\nAndromeda is one of the very few galaxies you can see with your naked eye from a dark site.\nIt\u2019s easy in binoculars, and if you use a small telescope, the galaxy fills the eyepiece.\nHowever, that\u2019s just the core, the nucleus, of Andromeda.\nLike the Milky Way, Andromeda has vast spiral arms that extend well out from the core.\nFrom Earth, the galaxy appears to be more than 3 degrees across \u2014 remember, there are 90 degrees in a right angle, and 360 degrees in a circle; astronomers use angular size as a way to measure how big an object is on the sky.\nPhil Plait\nPhil Plait writes Slate \u2019s Bad Astronomy blog and is an astronomer, public speaker, science evangelizer, and author of Death From the Skies!The Moon is about 0.5 degrees across ( about half the width of your thumb held at arm\u2019s length ), so Andromeda is about six times bigger\u2014roughly what\u2019s shown in the picture.\nIt may not be exact, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that important that it be perfect.\nIt\u2019s close enough, and certainly is an amazing thing to consider.\nAfter all, Andromeda is 2.5 million light years away\u201425 quintillion kilometers *  (15 quintillion miles)!\nIt\u2019s about 140,000 light years across (the Milky Way is about 100,000 for comparison), so even at that forbidding distance it takes up a noticeable amount of real estate in our sky.\nThe Moon is only about 3,500 kilometers across, but it\u2019s only 400,000 kilometers away.\nThat\u2019s a four-day ride via Apollo, but still a lot closer than even a nearby galaxy.\nAdvertisement\nI\u2019ll note I don\u2019t know where this picture comes from;

if the Moon\u2019s not up, I can guarantee they\u2019ll be looking at Andromeda during their public nights.\nAsk if you can see M31 (the official name of the galaxy; the 31 st object in Charles Messier\u2019s catalog) for added geek points.\nAnd there you go.\nNot all viral memes are bad, wrong, misguided, or dumb.\nSome are pretty much right on the money, and can actually lead to a \u201cgee-whiz\u201d moment, and to more knowledge and understanding.\nHow about that?\nThe Internet really is good for something after all!\n* Correction, Oct. 31, 2015: I originally wrote that Andromeda is 250 quintillion kilometers away.\nWhat's a factor of 10 between friends?\n\n",

Andromeda, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs  (2.5 million light-years) from Earth, and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.\n[4] Its name stems from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda.\nThe 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope revealed that the Andromeda Galaxy contains approximately one trillion stars,  [10] more than twice the number of the Milky Way\u2019s estimated 200-400 billion stars.\n[13] The Andromeda Galaxy, spanning approximately 220,000 light years, is the largest galaxy in our Local Group, which is also home to the Triangulum Galaxy and other minor galaxies.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy's mass is estimated to be around 1.76 times that of the Milky Way Galaxy (~0.8-1.5 \u00d7 10 12 solar masses  [9]  [10] vs the Milky Way's 8.5 \u00d7 10 11 solar masses).\nThe Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are expected to collide in ~4.5 billion years, merging to form a giant elliptical galaxy  [14] or a large disc galaxy.\n[15] With an apparent magnitude of 3.4, the Andromeda Galaxy is among the brightest of the Messier objects  [16] - making it visible to the naked eye on moonless nights,  [17] even when viewed from areas with moderate light pollution.\nContents [ hide ]1 Observation history1.1 Island universe2 General2.1 Formation and history2.2 Distance

External links\nObservation history  [ edit]Great Andromeda Nebula by Isaac Roberts, 1899.\nAround the year 964, the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi described the Andromeda Galaxy, in his Book of Fixed Stars as a \"nebulous smear\".\n[18]Star charts of that period labeled it as the Little Cloud.\n[19] In 1612, the German astronomer Simon Marius gave an early description of the Andromeda Galaxy based on telescopic observations.\n[20] The German philosopher Immanuel Kant in 1755 in his work Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens conjectured that the blurry spot was an island universe.\nIn 1764, Charles Messier cataloged Andromeda as object M31 and incorrectly credited Marius as the discoverer despite it being visible to the naked eye.\nIn 1785, the astronomer William Herschel noted a faint reddish hue in the core region of Andromeda.\nHe believed Andromeda to be the nearest of all the \"great nebulae\", and based on the color and magnitude of the nebula, he incorrectly guessed that it is no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius.\n[21] In 1850, William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse, saw and made the first drawing of Andromeda's spiral structure.\nIn 1864, William Huggins noted that the spectrum of Andromeda differs from a gaseous nebula.\n[22] The spectra of Andromeda displays a continuum of frequencies, superimposed with dark absorption lines that help identify the chemical composition of an object.\nAndromeda's spectrum is very similar to the spectra of individual stars, and from this, it was deduced that Andromeda has a stellar nature.\nIn 1885, a supernova  (known as S Andromedae) was seen in Andromeda, the first and so far only one observed in that galaxy.\nAt the time Andromeda was considered to be a nearby object, so the cause was thought to be a much less luminous and unrelated event called a nova, and was named accordingly; \"Nova 1885\".\n[23]In 1887, Isaac Roberts took the first photographs of Andromeda, which was still commonly thought to be a nebula within our galaxy.\nRoberts mistook Andromeda and similar spiral nebulae as solar systems being formed.\n[ citation needed] In 1912, Vesto Slipher used spectroscopy to measure the radial velocity of Andromeda with respect to our Solar System \u2014the largest velocity yet measured, at 300 kilometres per second (190 mi\/s).\n[24]Island universe  [ edit]Location of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in the Andromeda constellation.\nIn 1917, Heber Curtis observed a nova within Andromeda.\nSearching the photographic record, 11 more novae were discovered.\nCurtis noticed that these novae were, on average, 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky.\nAs a result, he was able to come up with a distance estimate of 500,000 light-years (3.2 \u00d7 10 10 AU).\nHe became a proponent of the so-called \"island universes\" hypothesis, which held that spiral nebulae were actually independent galaxies.\n[25]Andromeda Galaxy above the Very Large Telescope.\n[26] The Triangulum Galaxy is visible on the top.\nIn 1920, the Great Debate between Harlow Shapley and Curtis took place, concerning the nature of the Milky Way, spiral nebulae, and the dimensions of the Universe.\nTo support his claim of the Great Andromeda Nebula being, in fact, an external galaxy, Curtis also noted the appearance of dark lanes within Andromeda which resembled the dust clouds in our own galaxy, as well as historical observations of Andromeda Galaxy's significant Doppler shift.\nIn 1922 Ernst \u00d6pik presented a method to estimate the distance of Andromeda using the measured velocities of its stars.\nHis result placed the Andromeda Nebula far outside our galaxy at a distance of about 450,000 parsecs (1,500,000 ly).\n[27] Edwin Hubble settled the debate in 1925 when he identified extragalactic Cepheid variable stars for the first time on astronomical photos of Andromeda.\nThese were made using the 2.5-metre (100-in) Hooker telescope, and they enabled the distance of Great Andromeda Nebula to be determined.\nHis measurement demonstrated conclusively that this feature is not a cluster of stars and gas within our own Galaxy, but an entirely separate galaxy located a significant distance from the Milky Way.\n[28]In 1943, Walter Baade was the first person to resolve stars in the central region of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nBaade identified two distinct populations of stars based on their metallicity, naming the young, high-velocity stars in the disk Type I and the older, red stars in the bulge Type II.\nThis nomenclature was subsequently adopted for stars within the Milky Way, and elsewhere.\n(The existence of two distinct populations had been noted earlier by Jan Oort .)\n[29] Baade also discovered that there were two types of Cepheid variables, which resulted in a doubling of the distance estimate to Andromeda, as well as the remainder of the Universe.\n[30]In 1950, radio emission from the Andromeda Galaxy was detected by Hanbury Brown and Cyril Hazard at Jodrell Bank Observatory.\n[31]  [32] The first radio maps of the galaxy were made in the 1950s by John Baldwin and collaborators at the Cambridge Radio Astronomy Group.\n[33] The core of the Andromeda Galaxy is called 2C 56 in the 2C radio astronomy catalog.\nIn 2009, the first planet may have been discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThis was detected using a technique called microlensing, which is caused by the deflection of light by a massive object.\n[34]General  [ edit]The estimated distance of the Andromeda Galaxy from our own was doubled in 1953 when it was discovered that there is another, dimmer type of Cepheid.\nIn the 1990s, measurements of both standard red giants as well as red clump stars from the Hipparcos satellite measurements were used to calibrate the Cepheid distances.\n[35]  [36]Formation and history  [ edit]The Andromeda Galaxy as seen by NASA 's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.\nAndromeda Galaxy was formed roughly 10 billion years ago from the collision and subsequent merger of smaller protogalaxies.\n[37]This violent collision formed most of the galaxy's (metal-rich) galactic halo and extended disk.\nDuring this epoch, star formation would have been very high, to the point of becoming a luminous infrared galaxy for roughly 100 million years.\nAndromeda and the Triangulum Galaxy had a very close passage 2\u20134 billion years ago.\nThis event produced high levels of star formation across the Andromeda Galaxy's disk \u2013 even some globular clusters \u2013 and disturbed M33's outer disk.\nOver the past 2 billion years, star formation throughout Andromeda's disk is thought to have decreased to the point of near-inactivity.\nThere have been interactions with satellite galaxies like M32, M110, or others that have already been absorbed by Andromeda Galaxy.\nThese interactions have formed structures like Andromeda's Giant Stellar Stream.\nA galactic merger roughly 100 million years ago is believed to be responsible for a counter-rotating disk of gas found in the center of Andromeda as well as the presence there of a relatively young (100 million years old) stellar population.\n[ citation needed]Distance estimate  [ edit]At least four distinct techniques have been used to estimate distances from Earth to the Andromeda Galaxy.\nIn 2003, using the infrared surface brightness fluctuations  (I-SBF) and adjusting for the new period-luminosity value and a metallicity correction of \u22120.2 mag dex \u22121 in (O\/H), an estimate of 2.57 \u00b1 0.06 million light-years  (1.625 \u00d7 10 11 \u00b1 3.8 \u00d7 10 9 AU) was derived.\nIn 2004, using the Cepheid variable method, the distance was estimated to be 2.51 \u00b1 0.13 million light-years (770 \u00b1 40 kpc).\n[2]  [3]In 2005, an eclipsing binary star was discovered in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe binary  [c] is two hot blue stars of types O and B.\nBy studying the eclipses of the stars, astronomers were able to measure their sizes.\nKnowing the sizes and temperatures of the stars, they were able to measure their absolute magnitude.\nWhen the visual and absolute magnitudes are known, the distance to the star can be measured.\nThe stars lie at a distance of 2.52 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 0.14 \u00d7 10 6 ly (1.594 \u00d7 10 11 \u00b1 8.9 \u00d7 10 9 AU) and the whole Andromeda Galaxy at about 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 ly (1.6 \u00d7 10 11 AU).\n[4] This new value is in excellent agreement with the previous, independent Cepheid-based distance value.\nIn 2005, using the TRGB method, the distance was estimated to be 2.56 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 0.08 \u00d7 10 6 ly (1.619 \u00d7 10 11 \u00b1 5.1 \u00d7 10 9 AU).\n[5]Averaged together, these distance estimates give a value of 2.54 \u00d7 10 6 \u00b1 0.11 \u00d7 10 6 ly (1.606 \u00d7 10 11 \u00b1 7.0 \u00d7 10 9 AU).\n[a] And, from this, the diameter of Andromeda at the widest point is estimated to be 220 \u00b1 3 kly (67,450 \u00b1 920 pc).\n[ original research?]\nApplying trigonometry  ( angular diameter ), this is equivalent to an apparent 4.96 \u00b0 angle in the sky.\nMass and luminosity estimates  [ edit]Mass  [ edit]The Andromeda Galaxy pictured in ultraviolet light by GALEX.\nIllustration showing both the size of each galaxy and the distance between the two galaxies, to scale.\nGiant halo around Andromeda Galaxy.\n[38]Mass estimates for the Andromeda Galaxy's halo (including dark matter) give a value of approximately 1.5 \u00d7 10 12 M \u2609  [10]  (or 1.5 trillionsolar masses) compared to 8 \u00d7 10 11 M \u2609 for the Milky Way.\nThis contradicts earlier measurements, that seem to indicate that Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are almost equal in mass.\nEven so, Andromeda Galaxy's spheroid actually has a higher stellar density than that of the Milky Way  [39] and its galactic stellar disk is about twice the size of that of the Milky Way.\n[11] The total stellar mass of Andromeda Galaxy is estimated to be between 1.1 \u00d7 10 11 M \u2609 .,  [40]  [41]  (i.e., around twice as massive as that of the Milky Way) and 1.5 \u00d7 10 11 M \u2609, with around 30% of that mass in the central bulge, 56% in the disk, and the remaining 14% in the halo.\n[42]In addition to it, Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar medium contains at least around 7.2 \u00d7 10 9 M \u2609  [43] in the form of neutral hydrogen, at least 3.4 \u00d7 10 8 M \u2609 as molecular hydrogen  (within its innermost 10 kiloparsecs), and 5.4 \u00d7 10 7 M \u2609 of dust.\n[44]Andromeda Galaxy is surrounded by a large and massive halo of hot gas that is estimated to contain half the mass of the stars in the galaxy.\nThe nearly invisible halo stretches about a million light-years from its host galaxy, halfway to our Milky Way galaxy.\nSimulations of galaxies indicate the halo formed at the same time as the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe halo is enriched in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, formed from supernovae and its properties are those expected for a galaxy that lies in the \"green valley\" of the Galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram  (see below ).\nSupernovae erupt in Andromeda Galaxy's star-filled disk and eject these heavier elements into space.\nOver Andromeda Galaxy's lifetime, nearly half of the heavy elements made by its stars have been ejected far beyond the galaxy's 200,000-light-year-diameter stellar disk.\n[45]  [46]  [47]  [48]  [49]Luminosity  [ edit]Compared to the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy appears to have predominantly older stars with ages >7 \u00d7 10 9 years.\n[42]  [ clarification needed] The estimated luminosity of Andromeda Galaxy, ~2.6 \u00d7 10 10 L \u2609, is about 25% higher than that of our own galaxy.\n[50] However, the galaxy has a high inclination as seen from Earth and its interstellar dust absorbs an unknown amount of light, so it is difficult to estimate its actual brightness and other authors have given other values for the luminosity of the Andromeda Galaxy (some authors even propose it is the second-brightest galaxy within a radius of 10 mega - parsecs of the Milky Way, after the Sombrero Galaxy,  [51] with an absolute magnitude of around -22.21  [d] or close  [52] ).\nAn estimation done with the help of Spitzer Space Telescope published in 2010 suggests an absolute magnitude  (in the blue) of \u221220.89 (that with a color index of +0.63 translates to an absolute visual magnitude of \u221221.52,  [b] compared to \u221220.9 for the Milky Way), and a total luminosity in that wavelength of 3.64 \u00d7 10 10 L \u2609.\n[53]The rate of star formation in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3\u20135 solar masses for the Milky Way.\nThe rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy.\n[54]  [ not in citation given] This suggests that the latter once experienced a great star formation phase, but is now in a relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way is experiencing more active star formation.\n[50] Should this continue, the luminosity of the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.\nAccording to recent studies, the Andromeda Galaxy lies in what in the galaxy color\u2013magnitude diagram is known as the \"green valley\", a region populated by galaxies like the Milky Way in transition from the \"blue cloud\" (galaxies actively forming new stars) to the \"red sequence\" (galaxies that lack star formation).\nStar formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star-forming gas in the interstellar medium.\nIn simulated galaxies with similar properties to Andromeda Galaxy, star formation is expected to extinguish within about five billion years from the now, even accounting for the expected, short-term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way.\n[55]Structure  [ edit]The Andromeda Galaxy seen in infrared by the Spitzer Space Telescope, one of NASA 's four Great Space Observatories.\nImage of the Andromeda Galaxy taken by Spitzer in infrared, 24 micrometres  (Credit: NASA \/ JPL \u2013 Caltech \/K.\nGordon, University of Arizona ).\nA Swift Tour of Andromeda Galaxy.\nA Galaxy Evolution Explorer image of the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe bands of blue-white making up the galaxy's striking rings are neighborhoods that harbor hot, young, massive stars.\nDark blue-grey lanes of cooler dust show up starkly against these bright rings, tracing the regions where star formation is currently taking place in dense cloudy cocoons.\nWhen observed in visible light, Andromeda Galaxy\u2019s rings look more like spiral arms.\nThe ultraviolet view shows that these arms more closely resemble the ring-like structure previously observed in infrared wavelengths with NASA\u2019s Spitzer Space Telescope.\nAstronomers using the latter interpreted these rings as evidence that the galaxy was involved in a direct collision with its neighbor, M32, more than 200 million years ago.\nBased on its appearance in visible light, the Andromeda Galaxy is classified as an SA (s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs\u2013Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies.\n[1] However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.\n[56]In 2005, astronomers used the Keck telescopes to show that the tenuous sprinkle of stars extending outward from the galaxy is actually part of the main disk itself.\n[11] This means that the spiral disk of stars in the Andromeda Galaxy is three times larger in diameter than previously estimated.\nThis constitutes evidence that there is a vast, extended stellar disk that makes the galaxy more than 220,000 light-years (67,000 pc) in diameter.\nPreviously, estimates of the Andromeda Galaxy's size ranged from 70,000 to 120,000 light-years (21,000 to 37,000 pc) across.\nThe galaxy is inclined an estimated 77\u00b0 relative to Earth (where an angle of 90\u00b0 would be viewed directly from the side).\nAnalysis of the cross-sectional shape of the galaxy appears to demonstrate a pronounced, S-shaped warp, rather than just a flat disk.\n[57] A possible cause of such a warp could be gravitational interaction with the satellite galaxies near the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe Galaxy M33 could be responsible for some warp in Andromeda's arms, though more precise distances and radial velocities are required.\nSpectroscopic studies have provided detailed measurements of the rotational velocity of the Andromeda Galaxy as a function of radial distance from the core.\nThe rotational velocity has a maximum value of 225 kilometres per second (140 mi\/s) at 1,300 light-years  (82,000,000 AU) from the core, and it has its minimum possibly as low as 50 kilometres per second (31 mi\/s) at 7,000 light-years  (440,000,000 AU) from the core.\nFurther out, rotational velocity rises out to a radius of 33,000 light-years  (2.1 \u00d7 10 9 AU ), where it reaches a peak of 250 kilometres per second (160 mi\/s).\nThe velocities slowly decline beyond that distance, dropping to around 200 kilometres per second (120 mi\/s) at 80,000 light-years  (5.1 \u00d7 10 9 AU ).\nThese velocity measurements imply a concentrated mass of about 6 \u00d7 10 9 M \u2609 in the nucleus.\nThe total mass of the galaxy increases linearly out to 45,000 light-years  (2.8 \u00d7 10 9 AU ), then more slowly beyond that radius.\n[58]The spiral arms of the Andromeda Galaxy are outlined by a series of H II regions, first studied in great detail by Walter Baade and described by him as resembling \"beads on a string\".\nHis studies show two spiral arms that appear to be tightly wound, although they are more widely spaced than in our galaxy.\n[59] His descriptions of the spiral structure, as each arm crosses the major axis of the Andromeda Galaxy, are as follows  [60] \u00a7pp1062  [61] \u00a7pp92:\nBaade's spiral arms of M31Arms (N=cross M31's major axis at north, S=cross M31's major

the Andromeda Galaxy is seen close to edge-on, it is difficult to study its spiral structure.\nRectified images of the galaxy seem to show a fairly normal spiral galaxy, exhibiting two continuous trailing arms that are separated from each other by a minimum of about 13,000 light-years  (820,000,000 AU) and that can be followed outward from a distance of roughly 1,600 light-years  (100,000,000 AU) from the core.\nAlternative spiral structures have been proposed such as a single spiral arm  [62] or a flocculent  [63] pattern of long, filamentary, and thick spiral arms.\n[1]  [64]The most likely cause of the distortions of the spiral pattern is thought to be interaction with galaxy satellites M32 and M110.\n[65] This can be seen by the displacement of the neutral hydrogen clouds from the stars.\n[66]In 1998, images from the European Space Agency 's Infrared Space Observatory demonstrated that the overall form of the Andromeda Galaxy may be transitioning into a ring galaxy.\nThe gas and dust within the galaxy is generally formed into several overlapping rings, with a particularly prominent ring formed at a radius of 32,000 light-years  (2.0 \u00d7 10 9 AU) (10 kiloparsecs) from the core,  [67] nicknamed by some astronomers the ring of fire.\n[68] This ring is hidden from visible light images of the galaxy because it is composed primarily of cold dust, and most of the star formation that is taking place in the Andromeda Galaxy is concentrated there.\n[69]Later studies with the help of the Spitzer Space Telescope showed how Andromeda Galaxy's spiral structure in the infrared appears to be composed of two spiral arms that emerge from a central bar and continue beyond the large ring mentioned above.\nThose arms, however, are not continuous and have a segmented structure.\n[65]Close examination of the inner region of the Andromeda Galaxy with the same telescope also showed a smaller dust ring that is believed to have been caused by the interaction with M32 more than 200 million years ago.\nSimulations show that the smaller galaxy passed through the disk of the Andromeda Galaxy along the latter's polar axis.\nThis collision stripped more than half the mass from the smaller M32 and created the ring structures in Andromeda.\n[70] It is the co-existence of the long-known large ring-like feature in the gas of Messier 31, together with this newly discovered inner ring-like structure, offset from the barycenter, that suggested a nearly head-on collision with the satellite M32, a milder version of the Cartwheel encounter.\n[71]Studies of the extended halo of the Andromeda Galaxy show that it is roughly comparable to that of the Milky Way, with stars in the halo being generally \" metal-poor \", and increasingly so with greater distance.\n[39] This evidence indicates that the two galaxies have followed similar evolutionary paths.\nThey are likely to have accreted and assimilated about 100\u2013200 low-mass galaxies during the past 12 billion years.\n[72] The stars in the extended halos of the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way may extend nearly one-third the distance separating the two galaxies.\nNucleus  [ edit]Hubble image of the Andromeda Galaxy core showing possible double structure.\nNASA \/ ESA photo.\nM31 is known to harbor a dense and compact star cluster at its very center.\nIn a large telescope it creates a visual impression of a star embedded in the more diffuse surrounding bulge.\nIn 1991, the Hubble Space Telescope was used to image Andromeda Galaxy's inner nucleus.\nThe nucleus consists of two concentrations separated by 1.5 parsecs  (4.9 ly ).\nThe brighter concentration, designated as P1, is offset from the center of the galaxy.\nThe dimmer concentration, P2, falls at the true center of the galaxy and contains a black hole measured at 3\u20135 \u00d7 10 7 M \u2609 in 1993,  [73] and at 1.1\u20132.3 \u00d7 10 8 M \u2609 in 2005.\n[74] The velocity dispersion of material around it is measured to be \u2248 160 km\/s.\n[75]Chandra X-ray telescope image of the center of Andromeda Galaxy.\nA number of X-ray sources, likely X-ray binary stars, within the galaxy's central region appear as yellowish dots.\nThe blue source at the center is at the position of the supermassive black hole.\nIt has been proposed that the observed double nucleus could be explained if P1 is the projection of a disk of stars in an eccentric orbit around the central black hole.\n[76] The eccentricity is such that stars linger at the orbital apocenter, creating a concentration of stars.\nP2 also contains a compact disk of hot, spectral class A stars.\nThe A stars are not evident in redder filters, but in blue and ultraviolet light they dominate the nucleus, causing P2 to appear more prominent than P1.\n[77]While at the initial time of its discovery it was hypothesized that the brighter portion of the double nucleus is the remnant of a small galaxy \"cannibalized\" by Andromeda Galaxy,  [78] this is no longer considered a viable explanation, largely because such a nucleus would have an exceedingly short lifetime due to tidal disruption by the central black hole.\nWhile this could be partially resolved if P1 had its own black hole to stabilize it, the distribution of stars in P1 does not suggest that there is a black hole at its center.\n[76]Discrete sources  [ edit]The Andromeda Galaxy in high-energy X-ray and ultraviolet light (released 5 January 2016).\nArtist's concept of the Andromeda Galaxy core showing a view across a disk of young, blue stars encircling a supermassive black hole.\nNASA \/ ESA photo.\nApparently, by late 1968, no X-rays had been detected from the Andromeda Galaxy.\n[79] A balloon flight on October 20, 1970, set an upper limit for detectable hard X-rays from the Andromeda Galaxy.\n[80]Multiple X-ray sources have since been detected in the Andromeda Galaxy, using observations from the European Space Agency 's (ESA) XMM-Newton orbiting observatory.\nRobin Barnard et al.\nhypothesized that these are candidate black holes or neutron stars, which are heating the incoming gas to millions of kelvins and emitting X-rays.\nThe spectrum of the neutron stars is the same as the hypothesized black holes but can be distinguished by their masses.\n[81]There are approximately 460 globular clusters associated with the Andromeda Galaxy.\n[82] The most massive of these clusters, identified as Mayall II, nicknamed Globular One, has a greater luminosity than any other known globular cluster in the Local Group of galaxies.\n[83] It contains several million stars, and is about twice as luminous as Omega Centauri, the brightest known globular cluster in the Milky Way.\nGlobular One (or G1) has several stellar populations and a structure too massive for an ordinary globular.\nAs a result, some consider G1 to be the remnant core of a dwarf galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda in the distant past.\n[84] The globular with the greatest apparent brightness is G76 which is located in the south-west arm's eastern half.\n[19] Another massive globular cluster, named 037-B327 and discovered in 2006 as is heavily reddened by the Andromeda Galaxy's interstellar dust, was thought to be more massive than G1 and the largest cluster of the Local Group;  [85] however, other studies have shown it is actually similar in properties to G1.\n[86]Star clusters in the Andromeda Galaxy.\n[87]Unlike the globular clusters of the Milky Way, which show a relatively low age dispersion, Andromeda Galaxy's globular clusters have a much larger range of ages: from systems as old as the galaxy itself to much younger systems, with ages between a few hundred million years to five billion years  [88]In 2005, astronomers discovered a completely new type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe new-found clusters contain hundreds of thousands of stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters.\nWhat distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger\u2014several hundred light-years across\u2014and hundreds of times less dense.\nThe distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.\n[89]In 2012, a microquasar, a radio burst emanating from a smaller black hole, was detected in the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe progenitor black hole is located near the galactic center and has about 10.\nDiscovered through a data collected by the European Space Agency 's XMM-Newton probe, and subsequently observed by NASA 's Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission and Chandra X-Ray Observatory, the Very Large Array, and the Very Long Baseline Array, the microquasar was the first observed within the Andromeda Galaxy and the first outside of the Milky Way Galaxy.\n[90]Satellites  [ edit]Main article: Andromeda's satellite galaxies\nMessier 32 is to the left of the center, Messier 110 is to the bottom-right of the center.\nLike the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has satellite galaxies, consisting of 14 known dwarf galaxies.\nThe best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110.\nBased on current evidence, it appears that M32 underwent a close encounter with the Andromeda Galaxy in the past.\nM32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the relatively recent past.\n[91]M110 also appears to be interacting with the Andromeda Galaxy, and astronomers have found in the halo of the latter a stream of metal-rich stars that appear to have been stripped from these satellite galaxies.\n[92] M110 does contain a dusty lane, which may indicate recent or ongoing star formation.\n[93]In 2006, it was discovered that nine of the satellite galaxies lie in a plane that intersects the core of the Andromeda Galaxy; they are not randomly arranged as would be expected from independent interactions.\nThis may indicate a common tidal origin for the satellites.\n[94]Collision with the Milky Way  [ edit]Main article: Andromeda\u2013Milky Way collision\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 110 kilometres per second (68 mi\/s).\n[95] It has been measured approaching relative to our Sun at around 300 kilometres per second (190 mi\/s)  [1] as the Sun orbits around the center of our galaxy at a speed of approximately 225 kilometres per second (140 mi\/s).\nThis makes the Andromeda Galaxy one of about 100 observable blueshifted galaxies.\n[96] Andromeda Galaxy's tangential or sideways velocity with respect to the Milky Way is relatively much smaller than the approaching velocity and therefore it is expected to collide directly with the Milky Way in about 4 billion years.\nA likely outcome of the collision is that the galaxies will merge to form a giant elliptical galaxy  [97] or perhaps even a large disc galaxy.\n[15] Such events are frequent among the galaxies in galaxy groups.\nThe fate of the Earth and the Solar System in the event of a collision is currently unknown.\nBefore the galaxies merge, there is a small chance that the Solar System could be ejected from the Milky Way or join the Andromeda Galaxy.\n[98]Amateur observing  [ edit]The Andromeda Galaxy is bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, even with some light pollution.\n[99] Andromeda is best seen during autumn nights in the Northern Hemisphere, when from mid-latitudes the galaxy reaches zenith  (its highest point at midnight) so can be seen almost all night.\nFrom the Southern Hemisphere, it is most visible at the same months, that is in spring, and away from our equator does not reach a high altitude over the northern horizon, making it difficult to observe.\nBinoculars can reveal some larger structures and its two brightest satellite galaxies, M32 and M110.\n[100] An amateur telescope can reveal Andromeda's disk, some of its brightest globular clusters, dark dust lanes and the large star cloud NGC 206.\n[101]  [102]See also  [ edit]Andromeda Galaxy in fiction\nAndromeda Nebula in fiction\nList of galaxies\nList of Messier

Way, and situated within the same galactic cluster called the Local Group.\nIt appears to be within the constellation Andromeda, hence its name.\nLocated beyond the Milky Way, the Andromeda galaxy is one of the most distant objects visible to the unaided eye in the night sky.\nThe galaxy is the largest of the Local Group with perhaps as many as one trillion stars to the Milky Way's 200-400 billion stars.\n[3] Once thought to be the most massive galaxy as well, more recent studies have shown our galaxy is at least as massive.\n[4] Unlike most galaxies, Andromeda is moving towards us instead of receding as shown by its negative redshift .\nContents [ hide ]1 History of Observation2 Environment and Structure2.1 Galactic Nucleus2.2 Satellite Galaxies2.3 Galactic Halo3 References\nHistory of Observation\nAlthough most likely known for many years as a faint visible sky object, the first known recording of the Andromeda galaxy is by the Persian astronomer Abd-al-Rahman Al-Sufi in 964 A.\nD. is his Book of Fixed Stars.\nThere is no mention of the galaxy again until around 1500 when it appears on a Dutch map of the stars in 1500.\nThe galaxy was also observed and recorded by Simon Marius in 1612, which is the first known observation by telescope.\n[5] Charles Messier incorrectly gave credit for the discovery to Simon Marius, unaware of Al-Sufi work several centuries earlier, when he cataloged the galaxy as M31 in 1764.\nThe galaxy, when known as the Great Andromeda Nebula was thought to be relatively close.\nWilliam Herschel incorrectly estimated in 1785 that it was no more than 2,000 times the distance of Sirius.\nBecause astronomers were unaware of the \"nebula's\" true distance, when the first recorded supernova occurred in the galaxy in 1885 (called \"S Andromedae\"), it was thought too dim and instead simply a nova.\n[6]In 1887, for the first time photographs were taken of the galaxy, revealing its spiral shape.\nIn 1912 the \"nebula\" was measured by the Lowell Observatory at moving at a radial velocity of 300 km\/s towards the Earth.\n[7]The first person to discover the true distance and nature of Andromeda was Heber Curtis, when in 1917 he examined several previous photographs of the galaxy, finding 11 more novae, noting that they were 10 magnitudes fainter then similar novae in our own galaxy.\nBecause of this, he became a proponent of the \"island universes\" hypothesis, estimating Andromeda to be 500,000 light years distant, and as a separate galaxy.\nThe debate to whether Andromeda was another galaxy (and indeed if there were other galaxies) was conclusively settled when in 1923, when Edwin Hubble discovered the first extragalactic Cepheid variables, located within Andromeda, showing that it was not a nebulae within the Milky Way, but another distant galaxy.\n[8]The distance to the galaxy was again doubled when in 1953 when a second dimmer type of Cepheid variable was discovered.\nThis distance was further refined in the 1990s using the Hipparcos satellite to calibrate Cepheid distances using red giants and red clump stars.\n[9]Environment and Structure\nOlder image of the Andromeda galaxy\nImage of the Andromeda galaxy as taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the most studied galaxy outside our own.\nThis is due to the fact the structure of Andromeda is so similar to that of the Milky Way as in it contains generally the same celestial features, such as a spiral structure, globular and open clusters, interstellar dust and gas, planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and companion galaxies.\nUnlike our own galaxy, these features can be studies in Andromeda without nearby interstellar dust obscuring the view.\nThe Andromeda galaxy is wider, and more luminous then our own Milky Way.\nAndromeda also appears to contain far larger amount of stars, and is some 25% more luminous then are own galaxy.\nHowever our galaxy has 3 to 5 times the rate of star formation at present, as well as twice the rate of new supernovae.\nThis suggests that Andromeda had a much greater period of star formation in the past but has since become far more quiet then our own galaxy in that arena.\n[10]Although larger, the Andromeda galaxy appears to have a lower mass (300-400 billion solar masses for visible material), then our own Milky Way (at least 600 million solar masses for visible material).\nThis would make the Andromeda galaxy significantly less dense then our own.\nThese results are from calculated estimates of the total halo masses of the two galaxies accounting for the gravitational effects of dark matter.\nThis suggests Andromeda has a total mass of around 700 billion to 1.2 trillion solar masses compared to 0.93 to 1.9 trillion or more for the Milky Way.\n[11]One of the star clouds in Andromeda has its own NGC (New General Catalogue) number, known as NGC 206.\nThe region is one of the largest star-forming region known in the Local Group, filled with massive, young blue stars.\nThe region is located in the southwestern outer edge of the spiral disk.\nIt was first noted by William Herschel and was recorded as H V.36 in his catalog in 1786.\nGalactic Nucleus\nDouble nucleus of the Andromeda galaxy.\nIn the 1990s using the Hubble Space Telescope, it was thought that Andromeda may have two galactic nuclei when it was discovered that the galactic nucleus has two \"hot spots\".\nThe two nuclei appeared to be moving is respect to each other, although one is disrupting the other through tidal forces.\nAt first it was believed that one of the galactic nuclei was from a smaller galaxy that was consumed by Andromeda at some point in the past.\nMore recent observations using Hubble's imaging spectrograph in 2005 by a team of astronomers show though that the two two bright areas in the galactic core are actually composed of a bright, small dense disk of young blue stars within an elliptical ring of older red stars, all orbiting the supermassive black hole in the center.\n[12]Much like our own galaxy, Andromeda has a supermassive central black hole located at the center of the galactic nucleus.\nThe black hole itself has an estimated mass of 140 billion solar masses.\n[13] The Chandra X-Ray Observatory recently revealed other sources of x-rays within the galactic core.\nIt is believed most of these are due to binary systems where one star is losing mass to its neutron star or black hole companion.\nSatellite Galaxies\nAndromeda has 14 known dwarf satellite galaxies, of which M32 and M110 are the most well known and studied.\nM32 may have been once a large galaxy that was striped of its stellar disk by Andromeda after a close encounter, which also seemed to have caused a large burst in star formation in the dwarf galaxy until the recent cosmological past.\n[14] M110 also appears to be interacting with the Andromeda galaxy, this is due to metal-rich stars being located in the normally very metal-poor region of Andromeda's halo.\n[15] M110 is also appearing to be undergoing elevated star formation.\n[16]In 2006 it was discovered that nine of Andromeda's 14 satellite galaxies all lie within a thin sheet that runs perpendicular through Andromeda galactic disk and core and is almost perfectly aligned with the galaxy's polar axis.\nThe sheet runs through Andromeda's core and is almost exactly aligned with its polar axis.\nThis may indicate a single common tidal origin for these galaxies, such as left-overs of a breakup of a much more massive galaxy.\n[17]Galactic Halo\nAndromeda's halo is thought to be significantly larger and more diverse then that of the Milky Way.\nIn 2003, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers took the deepest visible light image of the night sky up to that time, pointing in the direction of Andromeda's halo.\nSome 300,000 stars in the halo were resolved and studied, and using the images, astronomers were able to estimate the ages of the various stars through an analysis of the distribution of their color and brightness.\nFurther research of the halo in 2007 found that several metal-poor red giants stars are orbiting at a substantial distance as part of the galactic halo, making Andromeda's total size possibly much larger than originally estimated.\n[18]Recently, a stream of younger, metal-rich stars have also been located in the galactic halo.\nThe presence of these stars seem to indicate the collision of the Andromeda galaxy with smaller galaxies that since have been absorbed.\n[19]References\u2191 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3  [1]\u2191 2.0 2.1

Allen (1899\/1963) reports that it was also appeared on a Dutch starmap of 1500.\nCharles Messier, who cataloged it on August 3, 1764, was obviously unaware of this early reports, and ascribed its discovery to Simon Marius, who was the first to give a telescopic description in 1612, but (according to R.\nH. Allen) didn't claim its discovery.\nUnaware of both Al Sufi's and Marius' discovery, Giovanni Batista Hodierna independently rediscovered this object before 1654.\nEdmond Halley, however, in his 1716 treat of \"Nebulae\", accounts the discovery of this \"nebula\" to the French astronomer Bullialdus  (Ismail Bouillaud), who observed it in 1661; but Bullialdus mentions that it had been seen 150 years earlier (in the early 1500s) by some anonymous astronomer ( R.\nH. Allen, 1899\/1963 ).\nIt was longly believed that the \"Great Andromeda Nebula\" was one of the nearest nebulae.\nWilliam Herschel believed, wrongly of course, that its distance would \"not exceed 2000 times the distance of Sirius\" (17,000 light years); nevertheless, he viewed it at the nearest \"island universe\" like our Milky Way which he assumed to be a disk of 850 times the distance of Sirius in diameter, and of a thickness of 155 times that distance.\nIt was William Huggins, the pioneer of spectroscopy, who noted in 1864 the difference between gaseous nebula with their line spectra and those \"nebulae\" with star-like, continuous spectra, which we now know as galaxies, and found a continuous spectrum for M31 ( Huggins and Miller 1864 ).\nIn 1887, Isaac Roberts obtained the first photographs of the Andromeda \"Nebula,\" which showed the basic features of its spiral structure for the first time.\nIn 1912, V.\nM. Slipher of Lowell Observatory measured the radial velocity of the Andromeda \"nebula\" and found it the highest velocity ever measured, about 300 km\/sec in approach.\nThis already pointed to the extra-galactic nature of this object.\nAccording to Burnham, a better value is about 266 km\/sec, but R. Brent Tully gives 298 km\/sec, and NED has again 300 +\/- 4 km\/s as the modern value.\nNote that all the previous values describe the motion with respect to our Solar System, i.e.\nheliocentric motion, not that w.r.t.\nthe Milky Way's Galactic Center.\nThe latter value can be obtained by correcting for the motion of our Solar System around that center.\nThe modern values for Galactic rotation and heliocentric radial velocity yield that the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are approaching each other at about 100 km\/sec.\nIn 1923, Edwin Hubble found the first Cepheid variable in the Andromeda galaxy and thus established the intergalactic distance and the true nature of M31 as a galaxy.\nBecause he was not aware of the two Cepheid classes, his distance was incorrect by a factor of more than two, though.\nThis error was not discovered until 1953, when the 200-inch Palomar telescope was completed and had started observing.\nHubble published his epochal study of the Andromeda \"nebula\" as an extragalactic stellar system (galaxy) in 1929  ( Hubble 1929 ).\nAt modern times, the Andromeda galaxy is certainly the most studied \"external\" galaxy.\nIt is of particular interest because it allows studies of all the features of a galaxy from outside which we also find in Milky Way, but cannot observe as the greatest part of our Galaxy is hidden by interstellar dust.\nThus there are continuous studies of the spiral structure, globular and open clusters, interstellar matter, planetary nebulae, supernova remnants (see e.g.\nJeff Kanipe's article in Astronomy, November 1995, p. 46), galactic nucleus, companion galaxies, and more.\nSome of the features mentioned above are also of interest for the amateur: Even Charles Messier found its two brightest companions, M32 and M110 which are visible in binoculars and conspicuous in small telescopes, and created a drawing of all three .\nThese two relatively bright and relatively close companions are visible in many photos of M31, including the one in this page.\nThey are only the brightest of a \"swarm\" of smaller companions which surround the Andromeda Galaxy, and form a subgroup of the Local Group.\nAt the time of this writing (September 2003), at least 11 of them are known: Besides M32 and M110 these are NGC 185, which was discovered by William Herschel, and NGC 147 (discovered by d'Arrest) as well as the very faint dwarf systems And I, And II, And III, possibly And IV (which may however be a cluster or a remote background galaxy), And V, And VI (also called the Pegasus dwarf), And VII (also Cassiopeia dwarf), and And VIII.\nIt is still not clear if M33, the smaller spiral galaxy in Triangulum, and its probable companion LGS 3 belong to this subgroup, or the more remote Local Group member IC 1613, or one of the possible member candidates UGCA 86 or UGCA 92.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is in notable interaction with its companion M32, which is apparently responsible for a considerable amount of disturbance in the spiral structure of M31.\nThe arms of neutral hydrogen are displaced from those consisted of stars by 4000 light years, and cannot be continuously followed in the area closest to its smaller neighbor.\nComputer simulations have shown that the disturbances can be modelled by a recent close encounter with a small companion of the mass of M32.\nVery probably, M32 has also suffered from this encounter by losing many stars which are now spread in Andromeda's halo.\nThe brightest globular cluster of the Andromeda Galaxy M31, G1, is also the most luminous globular in the Local Group of Galaxies; its apparent visual brightness from Earth is still about 13.72 magnitudes.\nIt outshines even the brightest globular in our Milky Way, Omega Centauri, and can be glimpsed even by better equipped amateurs under very favorable conditions, with telescopes starting at 10-inch aperture (see Leos Ondra 's article in Sky & Telescope, November 1995, p. 68-69).\nThe Hubble Space Telescope was used to investigate globular cluster G1 in mid-1994 (published April 1996).\nWhile the easiest, G1 is not the only M31 globular cluster which is in the reach of large amateur telescopes: Amateur Steve Gottlieb has observed 18 globular clusters of M31 with a 44cm telescope.\nWith their 14-inch Newton and CB245 CCD camera, observers of the Ferguson Observatory near Kenwood, CA have photographed G1 and four fainter M31 globulars .\nBarmby et.al  (2000) have found 435 globular cluster candidates in M31, and estimate the total number at 450 +\/- 100.\nThe astrophotographer is even better off, as he can gather the fainter light of the fine detail in the spiral arms, as in our image: Amateurs can obtain most striking pictures even with inexpensive equipment, from wide-field exposures to detailed close-ups.\nAlso in photography, better equipment pays off, as is demonstrated by our image, which was obtained by (and is courtesy of) Texas amateur Jason Ware, with a 6-inch refractor.\nMore information on this image is available.\nThe brightest star cloud in the Andromeda galaxy M31 has been assigned an own NGC number: NGC 206, because William Herschel had taken it into his catalog as H V.36 on the grounds of his discovery observation of October 17, 1786.\nIt is the bright star cloud at the upper left, just below a conspicuous dark nebula, in our photograph (very conspicuous in the larger photo ).\nDespite the large amount of knowledge we now have about the Andromeda Galaxy, its distance, though among the best known intergalactic distances, is not really well-known.\nWhile it is well established that M31 is about 15-16 times further away than the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the absolute value of this measure is still uncertain, and in current sources, usually given between 2.4 and 2.9 million light-years - a consequence of the uncertainty in the LMC distance and thus the overall intergalactic distance scale.\nE.g., the semi-recent correction from data by ESA's astrometrical satellite Hipparcos has pushed this value up by more than 10 percent, from about 2.4-2.5 to the about 2.9 million light-years we use here.\nUnder \"normal\" viewing conditions, the apparent size of the visible Andromeda Galaxy is about 3 x 1 degrees (our acurate value, given above, is 178x63 arc minutes, while NED gives 190x60').\nCareful estimates of its angular diameter, performed with 2-inch binoculars, by the French astronomer Robert Jonckhere in 1952-1953, revealed an extension of 5.2 times 1.1 degrees (reported by Mallas), corresponding to a disk diameter of over 250,000 light years at its distance of 2.9 million light years, so that this galaxy is more than double as large as our own Milky Way galaxy !\nIts mass was estimated at 300 to 400 billion times that of the sun.\nCompared to the newer estimates for our Milky Way galaxy, this is considerably less than the mass of our galaxy, implying that the Milky Way may be much denser than M31.\nThese results are confirmed by new estimates of the total halo masses, which turn out to be about 1.23 trillion solar masses for M31, compared to 1.9 trillion for the Milky Way ( Evans and Wilkinson, 2000 ).\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has revealed that the Andromeda galaxy M31 has a double nucleus.\nThis suggests that either it has actually two bright nuclei, probably because it has \"eaten\" a smaller galaxy which once intruded its core, or parts of its only one core are obscured by dark material, probably dust.\nIn the first case, this second nucleus may be a remainder of a possibly violent dynamical encountering event in the earlier history of the Local Group.\nIn the second case, the duplicity of Andromeda's nucleus would be an illusion causes by a dark dust cloud obstructing parts of a single nucleus in the center of M31.\nUp to now, only one supernova has been recorded in the Andromeda galaxy, the Supernova 1885, also designated S Andromedae.\nThis was the first supernova discovered beyond our Milky Way galaxy, on August 20, 1885, by Ernst Hartwig (1851-1923) at Dorpat Observatory in Estonia.\nIt reached mag 6 between August 17 and 20, and it was independently found by several observers.\nHowever, only Hartwig realized its significance.\nIt faded to mag 16 in February 1890.\nHistorical Observations and

M32 >Messier 31Spiral Galaxy M31 (NGC 224), type Sb, in Andromeda\nAndromeda Galaxy\nRight Ascension 00 : 42.7 (h:m)Declination +41 : 16 (deg:m)Distance 2900 (kly)Visual Brightness 3.4 (mag)Apparent Dimension 178x63 (arc min)Known to Al-Sufi about AD 905.\nMessier 31 (M31, NGC 224) is the famous Andromeda galaxy, our nearest large neighbor galaxy, forming the Local Group of galaxies together with its companions (including M32 and M110, two bright dwarf elliptical galaxies), our Milky Way and its companions, M33, and others.\nVisible to the naked eye even under moderate conditions, this object was known as the \"little cloud\" to the Persian astronomer Abd-al-Rahman Al-Sufi, who described and depicted it in 964 AD in his Book of Fixed Stars: It must have been observed by and commonly known to Persian astronomers at Isfahan as early as 905 AD, or earlier.\nR.\nH. Allen (1899\/1963) reports that it was also appeared on a Dutch starmap of 1500.\nCharles Messier, who cataloged it on August 3, 1764, was obviously unaware of this early reports, and ascribed its discovery to Simon Marius, who was the first to give a telescopic description in 1612, but (according to R.\nH. Allen) didn't claim its discovery.\nUnaware of both Al Sufi's and Marius' discovery, Giovanni Batista Hodierna independently rediscovered this object before 1654.\nEdmond Halley, however, in his 1716 treat of \"Nebulae\", accounts the discovery of this \"nebula\" to the French astronomer Bullialdus  (Ismail Bouillaud), who observed it in 1661; but Bullialdus mentions that it had been seen 150 years earlier (in the early 1500s) by some anonymous astronomer ( R.\nH. Allen, 1899\/1963 ).\nIt was longly believed that the \"Great Andromeda Nebula\" was one of the nearest nebulae.\nWilliam Herschel believed, wrongly of course, that its distance would \"not exceed 2000 times the distance of Sirius\" (17,000 light years); nevertheless, he viewed it at the nearest \"island universe\" like our Milky Way which he assumed to be a disk of 850 times the distance of Sirius in diameter, and of a thickness of 155 times that distance.\nIt was William Huggins, the pioneer of spectroscopy, who noted in 1864 the difference between gaseous nebula with their line spectra and those \"nebulae\" with star-like, continuous spectra, which we now know as galaxies, and found a continuous spectrum for M31 ( Huggins and Miller 1864 ).\nIn 1887, Isaac Roberts obtained the first photographs of the Andromeda \"Nebula,\" which showed the basic features of its spiral structure for the first time.\nIn 1912, V.\nM. Slipher of Lowell Observatory measured the radial velocity of the Andromeda \"nebula\" and found it the highest velocity ever measured, about 300 km\/sec in approach.\nThis already pointed to the extra-galactic nature of this object.\nAccording to Burnham, a better value is about 266 km\/sec, but R. Brent Tully gives 298 km\/sec, and NED has again 300 +\/- 4 km\/s as the modern value.\nNote that all the previous values describe the motion with respect to our Solar System, i.e.\nheliocentric motion, not that w.r.t.\nthe Milky Way's Galactic Center.\nThe latter value can be obtained by correcting for the motion of our Solar System around that center.\nThe modern values for Galactic rotation and heliocentric radial velocity yield that the Andromeda Galaxy and the Milky Way are approaching each other at about 100 km\/sec.\nIn 1923, Edwin Hubble found the first Cepheid variable in the Andromeda galaxy and thus established the intergalactic distance and the true nature of M31 as a galaxy.\nBecause he was not aware of the two Cepheid classes, his distance was incorrect by a factor of more than two, though.\nThis error was not discovered until 1953, when the 200-inch Palomar telescope was completed and had started observing.\nHubble published his epochal study of the Andromeda \"nebula\" as an extragalactic stellar system (galaxy) in 1929  ( Hubble 1929 ).\nAt modern times, the Andromeda galaxy is certainly the most studied \"external\" galaxy.\nIt is of particular interest because it allows studies of all the features of a galaxy from outside which we also find in Milky Way, but cannot observe as the greatest part of our Galaxy is hidden by interstellar dust.\nThus there are continuous studies of the spiral structure, globular and open clusters, interstellar matter, planetary nebulae, supernova remnants (see e.g.\nJeff Kanipe's article in Astronomy, November 1995, p. 46), galactic nucleus, companion galaxies, and more.\nSome of the features mentioned above are also of interest for the amateur: Even Charles Messier found its two brightest companions, M32 and M110 which are visible in binoculars and conspicuous in small telescopes, and created a drawing of all three .\nThese two relatively bright and relatively close companions are visible in many photos of M31, including the one in this page.\nThey are only the brightest of a \"swarm\" of smaller companions which surround the Andromeda Galaxy, and form a subgroup of the Local Group.\nAt the time of this writing (September 2003), at least 11 of them are known: Besides M32 and M110 these are NGC 185, which was discovered by William Herschel, and NGC 147 (discovered by d'Arrest) as well as the very faint dwarf systems And I, And II, And III, possibly And IV (which may however be a cluster or a remote background galaxy), And V, And VI (also called the Pegasus dwarf), And VII (also Cassiopeia dwarf), and And VIII.\nIt is still not clear if M33, the smaller spiral galaxy in Triangulum, and its probable companion LGS 3 belong to this subgroup, or the more remote Local Group member IC 1613, or one of the possible member candidates UGCA 86 or UGCA 92.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is in notable interaction with its companion M32, which is apparently responsible for a considerable amount of disturbance in the spiral structure of M31.\nThe arms of neutral hydrogen are displaced from those consisted of stars by 4000 light years, and cannot be continuously followed in the area closest to its smaller neighbor.\nComputer simulations have shown that the disturbances can be modelled by a recent close encounter with a small companion of the mass of M32.\nVery probably, M32 has also suffered from this encounter by losing many stars which are now spread in Andromeda's halo.\nThe brightest globular cluster of the Andromeda Galaxy M31, G1, is also the most luminous globular in the Local Group of Galaxies; its apparent visual brightness from Earth is still about 13.72 magnitudes.\nIt outshines even the brightest globular in our Milky Way, Omega Centauri, and can be glimpsed even by better equipped amateurs under very favorable conditions, with telescopes starting at 10-inch aperture (see Leos Ondra 's article in Sky & Telescope, November 1995, p. 68-69).\nThe Hubble Space Telescope was used to investigate globular cluster G1 in mid-1994 (published April 1996).\nWhile the easiest, G1 is not the only M31 globular cluster which is in the reach of large amateur telescopes: Amateur Steve Gottlieb has observed 18 globular clusters of M31 with a 44cm telescope.\nWith their 14-inch Newton and CB245 CCD camera, observers of the Ferguson Observatory near Kenwood, CA have photographed G1 and four fainter M31 globulars .\nBarmby et.al  (2000) have found 435 globular cluster candidates in M31, and estimate the total number at 450 +\/- 100.\nThe astrophotographer is even better off, as he can gather the fainter light of the fine detail in the spiral arms, as in our image: Amateurs can obtain most striking pictures even with inexpensive equipment, from wide-field exposures to detailed close-ups.\nAlso in photography, better equipment pays off, as is demonstrated by our image, which was obtained by (and is courtesy of) Texas amateur Jason Ware, with a 6-inch refractor.\nMore information on this image is available.\nThe brightest star cloud in the Andromeda galaxy M31 has been assigned an own NGC number: NGC 206, because William Herschel had taken it into his catalog as H V.36 on the grounds of his discovery observation of October 17, 1786.\nIt is the bright star cloud at the upper left, just below a conspicuous dark nebula, in our photograph (very conspicuous in the larger photo ).\nDespite the large amount of knowledge we now have about the Andromeda Galaxy, its distance, though among the best known intergalactic distances, is not really well-known.\nWhile it is well established that M31 is about 15-16 times further away than the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the absolute value of this measure is still uncertain, and in current sources, usually given between 2.4 and 2.9 million light-years - a consequence of the uncertainty in the LMC distance and thus the overall intergalactic distance scale.\nE.g., the semi-recent correction from data by ESA's astrometrical satellite Hipparcos has pushed this value up by more than 10 percent, from about 2.4-2.5 to the about 2.9 million light-years we use here.\nUnder \"normal\" viewing conditions, the apparent size of the visible Andromeda Galaxy is about 3 x 1 degrees (our acurate value, given above, is 178x63 arc minutes, while NED gives 190x60').\nCareful estimates of its angular diameter, performed with 2-inch binoculars, by the French astronomer Robert Jonckhere in 1952-1953, revealed an extension of 5.2 times 1.1 degrees (reported by Mallas), corresponding to a disk diameter of over 250,000 light years at its distance of 2.9 million light years, so that this galaxy is more than double as large as our own Milky Way galaxy !\nIts mass was estimated at 300 to 400 billion times that of the sun.\nCompared to the newer estimates for our Milky Way galaxy, this is considerably less than the mass of our galaxy, implying that the Milky Way may be much denser than M31.\nThese results are confirmed by new estimates of the total halo masses, which turn out to be about 1.23 trillion solar masses for M31, compared to 1.9 trillion for the Milky Way ( Evans and Wilkinson, 2000 ).\nThe Hubble Space Telescope has revealed that the Andromeda galaxy M31 has a double nucleus.\nThis suggests that either it has actually two

of NASA.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is one of two large spiral galaxies near our Milky Way Galaxy, the other being the Triangulum Galaxy.\n[2] Andromeda is closer to us than Triangulum is.\n[1]So how far away is the nearest galaxy to our own?\nTo answer the answer to this question, it\u2019s necessary to understand distances in space and the size of our galaxy.\nLet\u2019s start with Earth, which is about 8,000 miles (13,000 km) in diameter.\n[3] Understanding how large our planet is takes us to the next step.\nEarth is about 93,000,000 miles from our sun, or about 11,700 times the diameter of the Earth.\nThis distance is called one astronomical unit, or AU.\n[3] Astronomical units are often used for explaining distances in space, particularly within our solar system.\nThe speed of light, and a light year\nNext, the speed of light is important to understand.\nLight travels about 186,000 miles (300,000 km) per second.\n[4] Light takes a little more than eight minutes to travel from the sun to Earth.\nSomething traveling at light speed could race all the way around Earth, which is about 25,000 miles or 40,000 km in circumference, about 7.5 times in one second.\nCredit: Photo is from Wikipedia by ESO, CC BY 3.0.\nThe Triangulum Galaxy is the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, which includes our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.\n[2]Distances in space\nHere are the five planets in our solar system that are further away from the sun than we are.\nRanges vary due to orbits being elliptical:  [5]- Mars ranges from 1.4 to 1.7 AU from the sun.- Jupiter ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 AU.- Saturn ranges from 9.0 to 10.1 AU.- Uranus ranges from 18.4 to 20.1 AU.- Neptune ranges from 29.8 to 30.4 AU.\nSome other solar system objects that are further away from the sun include:- Dwarf planet Pluto ranges from 29.7 to 48.9 AU from the sun.\n[5]- Dwarf planet Eris ranges from 38.2 to 97.7 AU.\n[5]- Dwarf planet Sedna ranges from 76.4 to 937 AU.\n[6]Sedna takes about 11,400 years to orbit the sun, and at its furthest point, light from the sun would take 5.4 days to reach it.\nLuckily it\u2019s closer to us right now, at around 90 AU, or we wouldn't know about it.\n[6] It\u2019s thought that there are probably hundreds of dwarf planets in our solar system, or possibly thousands, and we only know of a small fraction of them.\n[7]One light year equals to 63,241 AU.\nTherefore our solar system, if it is defined by the orbits of known planets and dwarf planets, is far smaller than this, not even 2% of one light year.\nThe nearest star\nThe nearest star that isn\u2019t our sun, Proxima Centauri, is 4.24 light years away.\n[8] This is about 267,000 AU.\nThe distance, 4.24 light years, means it would take about four and a quarter years for light from our sun to reach the closest one outside of our solar system.\nThis vast distance to the closest star not in our solar system is about 24.9 trillion miles (40.1 trillion kilometers).\nCredit: Photo is in the public domain courtesy of NASA.\nAn artist's depiction of Proxima Centauri reflects that although called a red dwarf, the color is actually orange.\nA majority of stars in our galaxy are thought to be red dwarfs, which are considerably less massive than our sun, which is a yellow dwarf.\nProxima Centauri, despite being the closest star to our solar system, is not visible to us from Earth without the aid of a telescope.\n[8]The size of the Milky Way\nThe Milky Way likely has billions of solar systems.\nIt\u2019s unknown how many have planets have living beings.\nIn total there are certainly more than 100,000,000,000 (100 billion) stars, and possibly several times that many.\n[9]Our little solar system sits about halfway between the center of our galaxy and the edge.\nIn total, our galaxy, of which our solar system comprises a very tiny piece, is estimated to be 100,000 to 120,00o light years across or possibly more.\n[9]  [13] This means a diameter of at least 6,324,100,000 (over six billion) AU.\nBack to the original question\nThe information above is to provide a better understanding of the answer to the question, and to have more of an idea of what these distances mean.\nIt's easy get lost quickly with such vast numbers, as they\u2019re difficult for anyone to comprehend.\nThe Milky Way is part of a system of galaxies, in which other smaller nearby galaxies are gravitationally bound to it.\nIn total there are at least fourteen of these smaller satellite galaxies.\n[2] The closest is called Canis Major Dwarf, which scientists believe is in process of being pulled apart and made a part of the Milky Way.\nIt is located just 25,000 light years away.\n[10]Whether Canis Major Dwarf truly counts as a dwarf galaxy is disputed, and the next-closest dwarf galaxy, which is also part of the Milky Way system, is the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy, located 70,000 light years from Earth.\n[10]Of the small satellite galaxies thought to be associated with, and orbiting, the Milky Way, the one furthest from us is 2,250,000 light years away.\nThis is between 13 and 22 times the diameter of the Milky Way, depending on which of the various estimates of the size of our galaxy we're going by.\n[10]The closest large spiral galaxy similar to the Milky Way is the Andromeda Galaxy, which is very similar to our galaxy, and almost the same size.\nAndromeda is about 2,500,000 light years away, a distance 15 to 25 times that of the diameter of the Milky Way, and it probably has at least 19 smaller galaxies nearby that are orbiting it.\n[1]  [10]Of Andromeda\u2019s associated dwarf galaxies, ten or so are closer to us than Andromeda itself.\nThe closest galaxy to us that is not part of the Milky Way system is a dwarf galaxy associated with Andromeda called NGC 185, and it is slightly more than 2,000,000 light years away.\n[10]One more spiral galaxy is \"nearby\"Our Milky Way, the Andromeda, and one other spiral galaxy and their satellites comprise the Local Group of at least 54 galaxies (including the three and their satellites).\nThe third spiral galaxy is the Triangulum Galaxy, pictured above, which is smaller (about half the diameter), compared with Milky Way and Andromeda.\n[2]Triangulum is about 3,000,000 light years away.\nThe Local Group itself spans about 10,000,000 light years.\nThe Local Group is part of the Virgo Supercluster of at least 100 groups, the Local Group being just one of those.\nAnd this supercluster is one of millions that we know of.\n[11]  [2]Also, everything is constantly in motion.\nThe Milky Way and Andromeda are on trajectories to collide with one another in 3.75 billion years or so.\n[1]Okay, so the original question wasn\u2019t so easy to answer.\nBut now you know how complex this subject is.\nMilky Way Galaxy look-alike:\nCredit: Photo is from Wikipedia by ESO, CC BY 3.0.\nLocated 30 million light years away, NGC 6744 is the name of a galaxy that scientists say looks more like our Milky Way than any others located near enough to get a photo like this.\n[12]Next >> April Means It's Time for the Lyrid Meteor Showers\nShare Pin Tweet
